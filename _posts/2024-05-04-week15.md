## Blog Post Week 15

### Make your blog post. Reflect on the presentations from this week and your group's progress.
I was extremely nervous this week to present but after presenting, I feel quite good. I think the preparation my group and I did really showed in our presentation. I was also nervous about our contributions, especially wondering if they were enough compared to the other groups in class. After presenting, I feel good about it. If you look at our contributions only numerically, it may not seem too significant, but through presenting, we were able to describe some of the behind the scenes challenges we faced, thus presenting our contributions with more context and making me feel better about our performance on the project.
I also really enjoyed the other presentations from the other groups, some of the groups worked on projects I am also interested in, so it was nice to see how easy or hard it was to contribute to them so I can consider that in the future if I want to contribute.
